Introduction:

The gender pay gap remains a critical issue worldwide, with women often earning less than their male counterparts for comparable work. This project delves into the analysis of hourly earnings, focusing on gender disparities and trends over time. By examining a dataset that includes information on country, gender, year, and hourly earnings, we aim to shed light on the factors contributing to the gender pay gap and how it has evolved.

## Key Points:

## Descriptive Statistics: We perform basic statistical analyses to understand the distribution of hourly earnings by gender, year, and country. #DataAnalysis #DescriptiveStats

## Time Series Analysis: We conduct a time series analysis to identify trends in hourly earnings for both genders over the years. #TimeSeriesAnalysis #Trends

## Country-Wise Analysis: We examine variations in the gender pay gap across different countries, identifying regions with significant disparities. #CountryAnalysis #GenderDisparities

## Statistical Testing: We employ statistical tests such as the Mann-Whitney U test to determine the significance of gender pay gaps in specific contexts. #StatisticalTesting #Significance

## Long-Term Insights: By integrating these analyses, we aim to provide a holistic understanding of the gender pay gap, its drivers, and its evolution over time. This knowledge can inform policy recommendations and workplace initiatives aimed at reducing gender disparities in earnings. #GenderEquality #PolicyRecommendations
